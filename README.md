# M1S01-examples_HTML-CSS

## Creating a simple Curriculum Vitae and listing products of a store (using HTML & CSS).
This project introduces the basics of dealing with HTML and CSS. Each folder is progress on the project when compared to the previous one.

As these are the initial exercises of module 1 of the course taught by SENAI-SC + LAB365 (Brazil) for front-end, I have not separated them into a single project. This makes it easier to understand step by step.
